In Scappoose where the tall trees sway,
A little girl grew, in nature's play.
Hayden Richelle, now twenty years bright,
A beacon of joy, a guiding light.

From the moment you laughed, so pure and clear,
The world seemed kinder, full of cheer.
Raised in the whispers of Oregon's breeze,
Among cats and dogs, and neighbors with ease.

The outdoors called, your spirit so free,
In the heart of the wild, just you and the trees.
With Kyah beside you, in snow’s gentle fall,
Building memories, the best of them all.

Adventures in forests, under skies so grand,
Hand in hand with your sister, footprints in the sand.
The love for the earth, its beauty and grace,
Reflected in your heart, in every place.

Now you stand tall, at the brink of new dreams,
With the strength of the mountains, and rivers’ gleams.
May your journey ahead be as bright as the sun,
Full of love, laughter, and endless fun.

To Hayden Richelle, with love we impart,
Forever you'll be in the depths of our heart.
Happy 20th birthday, our precious dear,
May your path be blessed, year after year.
